We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data Vanguard collects and how it is used.  

1. **Data Collected**  
   Vanguard only collects the minimum data required to provide functionality:  
   - **Message content** (processed temporarily for spam/raid detection; not permanently stored).  
   - **User IDs** (for moderation logs and enforcement).  
   - **Server IDs and configuration settings** (for feature setup).  
   Vanguard does not collect personal information outside of Discord.  

2. **Data Storage**  
   - Data is stored only as long as necessary for functionality.  
   - Moderation logs may be stored for accountability until deleted by server staff.  
   - We do not sell, share, or use data for advertising.  

3. **Third Parties**  
   - All data remains within Vanguard and its hosting environment.  
   - Data may only be shared if required by law or by Discord.  

4. **User Rights**  
   - Server owners may request deletion of stored configuration or moderation logs at any time.  
   - Users may contact the developers to request removal of their personal data stored in moderation logs.  

5. **Changes**  
   - This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.  
   - Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
